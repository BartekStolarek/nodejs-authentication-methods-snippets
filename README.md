# Node.js Authentication Methods Snippets
This repository includes code snippets containing implementations of selected authentication methods in JavaScript and Node.js.

Selected authentication methods included in this repository:
* HTTP Basic Authentication
* HTTP Digest Authentication
* Session-based Authentication
* Token-based Authentication
* One Time Password Authentication
* Multi-factor Authentication
* OpenID Connect Authentication

> **Important note:** Implementations included in this repository are not complete implementations of authentication methods in Node.js environment, and will not work out of the box. They are just representing example flows in which selected authentication methods could be implemented, and some parts of the target implementations (like connection to the database, imports, or helper functions) were simplified or omitted.

> **Additional note:** This repository was created as an appendix for an Authentication Methods paper. It is currently in progress and will be linked here once completed.
